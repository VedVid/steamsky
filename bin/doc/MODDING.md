Some general information about adding/editing game elements (skills,
ships, ships modules, etc.)

## General information about modifications
To add new things (items, ships, modules, etc) to the game, you must create
a new
directory inside the game's mod directory which is *data/mods* by default.

For example, create the directory *mymod* as *data/mods/mymod*
and place your work in a file or files with the extension *dat*
patterned similarly to the structure of the shipped files there.

For example, to add a new item to game, create a file which looks like
*data/items.dat*.

Below you will find more detailed information about the
XML data structures used by the program.

You may can edit the shipped files as well of course, but modification
you make there will be overwritten when you update the game.

## Items types

### General information
- Open file *game.dat* in *data* directory or even better, create a new file in
  modifications directory.
- A file providing new items must start with tag `data`. Each item type is one
  line entry with tag `itemtype`. Structure your work on what you see in
  the *data/game.dat* file.

### Changing an existing items types
- By editing the *data/game.dat* file you can change the name of an existing item type

### Removing item types
- You can remove item types from *data/game.dat* by removing their tag.
- Alternatively, your mod may have a `remove` tag with the attributes `name`
  set to `itemtype` and `value` set to the name of type to be removed.
- After deleting item types, don't forget remove any references to it in other
  data files.

  the selected attribute. Value between `attribute` tags is a description of
