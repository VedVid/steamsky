Steam Sky is open source, roguelike game in steampunk theme. Your role in this
game is to command flying ship and its crew, traveling between floating bases,
fighting with enemies, trading goods, etc. The game is more strategy based
than tactical like most of roguelikes. There is no end goal for game, and you
can play as long as your character does not die. Game is under heavy
development, but is generally playable. Now game is available on Linux and
Windows (both 64-bit).

## Features
- Buy cheaply, sell expensive: find best trade routes between sky bases.

    Each base type sell other items. Some bases even only buy items. Prices of
    items in bases depends on bases types. For example, it is good idea to buy
    food in agricultural bases and sell it to industrial bases.

- Do randomly generated missions to gain money and reputation at sky bases.

    Patrol selected map areas, explore unvisited areas, deliver items to bases,
    etc. Some missions may require some free cargo space, others may depends on
    installed ship modules.

- Manage your ship's crew: give them orders, hire new ones or dismiss old
  members.

    Your crew and your character must eat and drink, wounded, hungry or tired
    crew members works slower. As crew members spend some time on given order
    he or she will gain experience in selected skill which allow works faster
    or more precise.

- Manage your ship: upgrade installed modules, install new ones, or repair
  damaged ones.

    Progress in game depends on installed ship modules. With stronger modules,
    you have bigger chance to meet stronger enemies. You must balance your
    progress between gaining experience by crew members and installing new,
    better ship modules. Or some day, you meet too strong enemy for you.

- Craft items: from tools through repair materials to food.

    At start you know only few basic crafting recipes. New recipes may be
    bought from bases or discovered by deconstructing items. Better crafter can
    craft more items from this same amount of materials.

- Fight with enemy ships in tactical combat.

    Give orders to your crew at begining of each combat round and watch result
    when turn passed. Change ship speed, position of ship in combat or give
    your gunners orders to attack selected part of enemy ship. If enemy is too
    strong for you, you can try escape from combat too.
